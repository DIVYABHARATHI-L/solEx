# solEx - Advanced Solar Power Distribution and Sharing System

An innovative platform designed to optimize the use of surplus solar energy by connecting solar panel owners (proconsumers) with consumers in need. This system enables efficient redistribution of excess solar power through a centralized hub, promoting sustainability and reducing reliance on non-renewable energy.
